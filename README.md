# Project Overview
I was assigned by a company to convert existing static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files into a dynamic, component-based React application. I have successfully completed the task using Create React App to scaffold the project.

This project organizes the previously static HTML into modular React components, enabling better reusability and maintainability of the codebase. All styles and scripts have been effectively integrated within the React framework.
